#  Recommendations for Improvement

### 1. Architecture & Code Organization
* **Suggestion:** create reusable components:
* **Benefits:**  smaller files, easier testing, clearer boundaries, and re-use across pages.

* **Suggestion:** Centralized routes: With React Router 7, consider a single place to define routes and use lazy loading (React.lazy + Suspense) for sector pages to reduce initial bundle size.
* **Benefits:** Improves initial load performance, especially for larger apps.

### 2. Routing and Navigation
* **Suggestion:** Ensure all Links are absolute to avoid relative path surprises unless deliberately nested. The Sectors page should use absolute paths for each sector (e.g., "/beauty", "/ict", "/construction", "/hospitality").
* **Benefits:** Prevents navigation bugs when the current path is not the root.

* **Suggestion:** 404 route: Add a fallback NotFound page to catch unknown routes.
* **Benefits:** Improves UX by guiding users when they hit an invalid URL.

### 3. Internationalization / Language Switcher
* **Suggestion:** this is usually done with an i18n library (react-i18next) with JSON translation files for en, fr, sw, ar, rw.
* **Benefits:** Enables multi-language support and better user experience for diverse audiences.

### 4. Environment Configuration & Secrets

* **Issue:** Committing real environment keys to the repo can pose security risks.
* **Suggestion:** Use a `.env.example` file to document required keys, and ensure real secrets are excluded from version control.
* **Benefits:** Improves security and makes onboarding easier for new developers.

### 5  Centralize API client:
* **Suggestion:**  Create a single HTTP client (axios or fetch wrapper) with baseURL, interceptors, and consistent auth headers/error handling. 
* **Benefits:**  reduces code duplication, improves maintainability, and ensures consistent API interactions.
